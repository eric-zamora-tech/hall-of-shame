# Hall of Shame: A GitHub Streak Reminder App

Welcome to the Hall of Shame, where forgotten GitHub contributions go to rest (or rather, to roast). This project is your personal accountability buddy, ensuring that no day passes without pushing code — or at least acknowledging your negligence with a shameful card.

## What’s the Deal?
Have you ever missed a day on your GitHub commit streak? If so, you know the feeling: a mixture of horror, regret, and a sense that your digital life is spiraling out of control. Fear not! This React application is here to save you, but also remind you of your failure — humorously, of course.

## Features
* **Daily Contribution Check:** Uses the GitHub GraphQL API to check if you’ve pushed any code today.
* **Shame Cards:** If you forget, a new card is automatically generated to remind you of your negligence. It's like a participation trophy for bad behavior!
* **Responsive Design:** Looks good on both desktop and mobile because who doesn’t want to be shamed on the go?

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hall-of-shame.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd hall-of-shame
npm install
```
3. Run the app:
```bash
npm start
```

4. **Setup your GitHub token:** You’ll need to provide a personal access token to access the GitHub API. Don’t worry, it’s safer than your grandma's secret cookie recipe!

5. **Enjoy your shame:** Check the app every day to see if you’ve pushed. If you haven’t, brace yourself for your digital disgrace!

## Why?
Because let’s face it, who doesn’t love a little public humiliation? And if you can’t laugh at your own procrastination, what’s the point of coding?

## Contributing
Feel free to add more shameful features! Open an issue or submit a pull request if you have a brilliant idea that will further enhance our collective guilt.
